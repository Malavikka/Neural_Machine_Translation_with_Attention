# Neural Machine Translation with Attention
Machine translation is the task of automatically converting source text in one language to text in another language. In recent years, Neural Machine Translation has emerged as a way of addressing this task. In this project, we explore different configurations for setting up a Neural Machine Translation System for language Hindi. Here, we are building a sequence to sequence translator using the Bahdanau Attention mechanism, to convert hindi sentences to english using various concepts like autoencoders and basic NLP text tokenization techniques
